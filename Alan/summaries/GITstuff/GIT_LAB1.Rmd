## GIT - Notes
### Alan T. Arnholt

Last compiled:
```{r Systime, echo = FALSE, comment = NA, engine = "R"}
format(Sys.time(), "%A, %B %d, %Y - %X.")
```

Download and install the lastest version of [Git.](http://git-scm.com/downloads)



```{r label = SETUP, echo = FALSE}
opts_chunk$set(comment = NA, engine = "bash", fig.align="center", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4, dev ="png")
```

If you have never used git before, you need to do some setup first.  Run the following
commands so that git knows your name and email.  The commands are all issued in the
Terminal (MAC) or at the command prompt (Windows).  The Terminal application is 
usually found in `/applications/Utilities`.  To open a command prompt, click on the 
Windows icon -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt.  The third line adds 
pretty command line colors.  


```{r label = GITsetup, eval = FALSE}
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"
git config --global color.ui true
```

If you do not want to type your username and password every time you work with a remote server, you will to install the credential helper.

### Creating a GitHub Account

Point your browser to [https://github.com](https://github.com),
type a username in the `Pick a username` box (please use `firstlast`, for example my username is `alanarnholt`), enter your email (use your school email) in the `Your email` box, type in your password in the `Create a password` box. Then, click the `Sign up for GitHub` box and you will have a GitHub account.


### Creating a GitHub Repository

In order to push your local work to a remote repository, you will first need to create
the remote repository. Log into your GitHub account, click the `New repository` button,
then give your repository a name and optionally a description.  When you finish, click 
the `Create repository` button and your GitHub repository will be created.

## Local Repositories

It is possible to set up a local repository using GUI (drop, drag, etc.) commands or to use the command line.  I keep my repositories in a folder called *git_repositories* that is a subfolder of my *USERNAME* directory.


To check the current status of your repository type:
```{r label = STATUS}
git status
```
The `git status` shows us what files are not staged for a commit.  Before files cna be
committed, they must be added to the staging area.  Files are added to the stating area
with the command `git add file_name`.  To add all files in the working directory, one
can use `git add .`  Next all files are added to the staging area and a snapshot is 
taken of the commit with the message "staging all files".
```{r label = ADD}
git add .
git commit  -m "staging all files"
```

Check the status after the last commit.
```{r label = STATUS2}
git status
```
Push changes to the remote repository. 
```{r label = PUSH}
git push
```
See if there is anything left to do.
```{r label = STATUS3}
git status
```
Show the last three commits with
```{r label = LOG}
git log  -3
```

That was ugly. Let us try some formatting.

```{r label = LOGP}
git log --pretty=oneline -3
```

The previous output was to brief for my likes.  Let us try some further formatting.

```{r label = LOGP2}
git log --pretty=format:"%h %ad- %s [%an]" -3
```

Maybe even some statistics?

```{r label = LOGP3}
git log --pretty=format:"%h %ad- %s [%an]" -3 --stat
```

Now, just to show how cool this is, we will mix in a little `R`.

```{r label= Rgraph, engine = 'R'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = CO2, aes(x = Type, y = uptake)) + geom_boxplot()
```
