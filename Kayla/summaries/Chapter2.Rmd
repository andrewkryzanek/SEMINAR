**_Chapter 2: Practical tips for reproducible research_**
========================================================
* Waiting till the end of the research process to think about reproducibility most of the time results in incomplete documentation
* Focus on reproducibility needs to happen from the begging of the research 

**2.1: The Big Picture: A workflow for reproducible research**

* Three stages of most research projects
  * Data gathering
  * Data analysis
  * Results presentation
* Always think about how different stages tie together, that will result in more reproducible research

* Document everything
  * Documenting everything is key in producing reproducible research
  * Record session information in R 
  * Note packages that might need to be used 
  * “sessionInfo” command in R prints the record of everything
* Everything is a (text) file
  * Try to use the simplest file format when saving information
  * Text files help to future proof your work
* All files should be readable by humans
  * Comment on code so that you understand the design and purpose later down the road 
  * # in R, % in LaTeX are the comment commands
* Explicitly tie your files together
  * Tie commands are most helpful when trying to link all the files together 
* Have a plan on how you will organize, store, and make the files available 
  * Limit the amount of content any one file has 
  * Need to be organized so that researchers know how they fit together
