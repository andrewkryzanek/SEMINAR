Chapter 1 Summary- Introducing Reproducible Research
Erin Kreiling
========================================================

1.1 What is Reproducible Research?
- Research results are considered to be replicable or reproducible if there is sufficient information available for independent researchers to repeat the same processes and obtain the same results and conclusions.
- "Really reproducible research" means that all of the data and code necessary is available to the researcher and also allows said researcher to repeat the procedure and obtain the same findings as the original researcher.
- If a study is difficult to reproduce it's more likely that no one will reproduce it. 

1.2 Why Should Research Be Reproducible?
- Replication is considered to be the "demarcation between science and non-science".
- The validity of scientific claims is measured by the ability to reproduce the experiment.
- Reproducible research allows researchers to build upon established work, rather than repeating the same procedures over and over and wasting time.
- Better work habits make it easy to find mistakes and allows the researcher to find past work far quicker.
- Being conscientious with working methods inspires more teamwork and collaboration.
- Even if no one else does, you will almost definitely reproduce your own research and taking time to make this easier will benefit you in the long run.
- "The goal of reproducible research is to have more impact with our research."

1.3 Who Should Read This Book?
- The more researchers that use the tools of reproducibility the better.
- Using clear documentation will enrich your learning process and reinforce the material in your mind as a student.

1.4 The Tools of Reproducible Research
- Reproducible Research Environment: statistical tools necessary to run analyses and the ability to track data and redistribute it
- Reproducible Research Publisher: set of tools that prepares final documents of research
- Main tools: R, knitr, Markup languages, RStudio, Cloud storage and versioning, and Unix-like shell programs.

1.5 Why Use R, knitr, and RStudio for Reproducible Research
- R is being constantly updated and can be used in conjunction with knitr, LaTeX, and Markdown.
- R forces you to explicity document all of your research steps through source code, so it promotes reproducible research far more than Graphical User Interface programs. 
- knitr can do everything that Sweave can and more. 
- knitr can work with many different languages; it is very versatile.
- RStudio is a happy medium between R and a pure GUI.
- RStudio is a very good stand alone editor for LaTeX and Markdown.
- You can even use RStudio for C++, CSS, and JavaScript.

1.6 Book Overview
- This book explains how using various tools to make your research reproducible.
