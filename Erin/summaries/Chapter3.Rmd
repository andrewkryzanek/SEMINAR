========================================================

3.1 Using R: the Basics
- Key parts of R: objects & assignment, component selection, functions and commands, arguments, the workspace & history, and packages. 
- Objects are like the R language's nouns. 
- R is object-oriented. 
- <- is an assignment operator
- ## is followed by output
- Character strings must be enclosed by '' or "".
- It is very important to to keep in mind the type of object you are using to avoid warning messages. 
- class will tell you the type of an object.
- Vectors are a group of numbers, character strings, etc. 
- c = concatenate 
- data.frame can combine characters and numbers into rows and columns.
- R recognizes whichever label has been assigned most recently.
- A dollar sign is called a component selector.
- The attach command attaches a database to R's search path. 
- head shows first few values of a variable. 
- Subscripts (like []) allow you to view and analyze specific parts of a data set.
- Arguments modify what commands do.

3.2 Using RStudio
- RStudio is very similar to R but with more features.

3.3 Using knitr: the Basics
- knitr ties together your presentation of results with the creation of those results.
- The knitr process:
 - Create a knittable markup document.
 - knitr knits.
 - knitr inserts marked-up results into a document that only contains markup for the presentation document.
 - Compile the document.
- R code should be put into code chunks in order to be presented. 
- R Markdown code chunks begin with ```{r}
- Sweave-style code chunks begin with << >>=
- Rtex-style code chunks begin with %%
- Global: applies to the entire document.
- knitr is a regular R package so you can knit documents in R.
