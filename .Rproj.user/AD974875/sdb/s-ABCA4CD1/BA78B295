    "contents" : "Chapter 5 Summary- Storing, Collaborating, Accessing Files, & Versioning\n========================================================\n\n- Storing data in a cloud is safer than on your computer or a flash drive because it is protected.\n- Cloud storage allows access to documents from any computer or mobile device and can open up research to more collaborators. \n- Version control manages the different versions of a piece of work and monitors changes.\n \n5.1 Saving Data in Reproducible Formats\n- Using text file formats helps future proof your research.\n- write.table saves data in plain-text formats from R.\n\n5.2 Storing Your Files in the Cloud: Dropbox\n- Dropbox creates a directory on your computer's hard drive in which files are stored, as well in the cloud-based server.\n- Folders on Dropbox can be either Public or Non-Public.\n- An SHA-1 hash is a long string of numbers and letters at the end of a line that serves as a unique ID, assigned by source_data.\n- You cannot save files through a Dropbox URL link.\n- Every time you save a document a new version is created on Dropbox.\n\n5.3 Storing Your Files in the Cloud: GitHub\n- GitHub is an interface and cloud hosting service built on top of the Git version control system. \n- Basically, GitHub has everything that Dropbox has and more, but is more complicated to use as a novice.\n- GitHub stores previous versions indefinitely.\n- .gitignore makes Git ignore particular files.\n- Asterisks are wildcards that stand for any character.\n- You can add files to a new repository at any time by \"pushing\" them.\n- The GitHub interface allows anyone to look at text files with a browser file.\n- Anyone with a GitHub account can suggest changes to a file in a public repository. \n- Public repositories can have unlimited collaborators. \n- Basic GitHub workflow: 1. add changes with git add, 2. commit the changes, 3. pull changes, resolve any merge conflicts, and commit changes, 4. push your changes to GitHub\n\n5.4 RStudio & GitHub\n- You can Git initialize new RStudio projects, Git initialize existing projects, and create RStudio projects from cloned repositories. \n- The Review Changes window allows you to commit changes.\n",
