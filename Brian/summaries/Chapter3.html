<h1>Chapter 3 Getting Started with R, RStudio, and Knitr</h1>

<h1>R</h1>

<p>R is a statistical programming language, often referred to as an &ldquo;object-oriented language.&rdquo; This means everything can be viewed as objects and R commands or functions call for actions on those objects.</p>

<p>An <strong>object</strong> can be numeric or character-stringed or both. The simplest form of an object in R is a <strong>vector</strong>, which is an ordered group of numbers, character strings, or both. Other typical types of object include: data frame, matrix, and table, which are usually made up by putting together several vectors.</p>

<p>Working with data in a vectors, such as displaying or performing calculations, is quite simple. However, manipulating data within a data frame requires some extensive knowledge. One useful way to select certain part of a data frame is the use of the <em>componenent selector</em> ($). For example, using this R command <code>mean(data$subdata1)</code> means that we want to calculate the mean of <code>subdata1</code> which is a vector in the data frame <code>data</code>.</p>

<p>A <strong>function* or **command</strong> acts on objects. In R, a command is followed by the set parentheses enclosing the specified object that the command will act on, along with a set of command arguments. For example, <code>mean(x=data, trim=0.10)</code>. To find all the arguments that a command can accept look at the <strong>Arguments</strong> section of the command&#39;s help file. To access the help file type: <code>?command</code>; for example, <code>?mean</code>.</p>

<h1>RStudio</h1>

<p>RStudio is an integrated development environment for R. It provides a centralized and well organized place to do almost anything we want with R, and more. A default RStudio window contain three panes. The one on the left side is the <em>Console</em> which functions exactly the same as the console in regular R. In the upper right-hand corner, the <em>Workspace/History</em> helps users keep track of objects they have in the workspace, and the history of the commands they have run. Finally, the <em>Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer</em> pane in the lower right-hand corner helps user navigate their files, see plots, or pull up help files.</p>

<h1><code>knitr</code></h1>

<p>The package <code>knitr</code> is an R package with commands for tying analysis code into presentation documents including those written in Latex and Markdown. The <code>knitr</code> process takes three steps. It begins with a <em>knittable</em> document that we create containing analysis source codes and rules for how to format the text (the markup). Then <code>knitr</code> will <em>knit</em> the source document into a <em>markup only document</em>. Finally, it then compiles the markup document into a presentation document such as pdf or html.</p>
